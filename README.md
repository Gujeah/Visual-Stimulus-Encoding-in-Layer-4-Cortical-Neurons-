# Visual-Stimulus-Encoding-in-Layer-4-Cortical-Neurons-

The primary visual cortex (V1) is the brainâ€™s first stage of cortical visual processing, where neurons encode features like edges, orientations, and textures. Layer 4 (L4) is particularly crucial as it receives direct thalamic input from the eyes and acts as a "gatekeeper" for visual information.

Static Gratings: Simple, parametric stimuli (e.g., oriented bars) help isolate tuning properties (e.g., orientation selectivity).

Natural Scenes: Complex, ecologically relevant images reveal how neurons process real-world visual input.

A key question is whether the same neurons encode both artificial (gratings) and natural stimuli, or if specialized subpopulations exist. This project leverages the Allen Institute Neuropixels dataset to investigate this in mouse V1.
