# Biological Context

The primary visual cortex (V1) serves as the first cortical stage of visual processing, where neurons transform retinal input into feature representations. Layer 4 (L4) occupies a privileged position in this hierarchy, receiving direct thalamocortical projections from the lateral geniculate nucleus and serving as the main entry point for visual information to the cortex.

# The Experiment: Gratings vs. Natureâ€™s Chaos

Visual neuroscience has traditionally relied on simplified stimuli like static gratings - controlled patterns of oriented bars that permit systematic investigation of fundamental tuning properties such as orientation and spatial frequency selectivity. However, the natural visual environment presents organisms with complex, statistically rich stimuli that may engage different processing mechanisms.
